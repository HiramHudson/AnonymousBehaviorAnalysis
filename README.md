## 🎯 Overview

Anonymous Behavior Analysis is a cutting-edge decentralized application that enables secure, privacy-preserving collection and analysis of user behavioral data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this platform ensures that sensitive behavioral patterns remain encrypted throughout the entire data lifecycle.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
Our platform leverages FHE technology to perform computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This revolutionary approach ensures:

- **Complete Privacy**: Raw behavioral data never exists in plaintext on the blockchain
- **Secure Analysis**: Patterns can be analyzed while maintaining user anonymity
- **Zero-Knowledge Insights**: Derive valuable insights without exposing individual behaviors

### Anonymous Behavior Analysis
The system focuses on collecting and analyzing behavioral patterns while maintaining user privacy:

- **Session Tracking**: Encrypted recording of user activity sessions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of behavioral trends without exposing individual data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Privacy-preserving detection of unusual behavior patterns
- **Metrics Calculation**: Secure computation of privacy scores and variability indices

## 🏗️ Smart Contract Architecture

**Contract Address**: `0x760E186B48583A49d97EacdD6901a3a0990622A7`

The core smart contract implements several key components:

### Data Structures
- **BehaviorSession**: Encrypted session data including duration, activity levels, and interaction types
- **BehaviorPattern**: Aggregated behavioral patterns for users
- **PrivacyMetrics**: Privacy scores and anomaly detection results

### Key Functions
- **Session Recording**: `recordBehaviorSession()` - Encrypt and store behavioral data
- **Pattern Analysis**: `analyzeBehaviorPattern()` - Analyze user behavior patterns
- **Privacy Metrics**: `updatePrivacyMetrics()` - Update privacy scores and anomaly levels
- **Analyst Management**: `authorizeAnalyst()` - Manage authorized data analysts

## 🎮 Features
